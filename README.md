![Hand Rhythm GIF](/hand_rhythm.gif "Hand Rhythm GIF")

## 💡 Idea
**Elevator Pitch:**  
*"What if you could play rhythm games like Beat Saber or Guitar Hero - but with just your hands, in your own living space?"*  

This prototype demonstrates the potential of **controller-free interaction** in XR, using hand tracking as a next-gen game mechanic. By combining:  
- 🎶 Music rhythm gameplay  
- ✋ Hand pose matching  
- 🏠 Room-scale presence  

We create an immersive experience that challenges players' **agility and fine motor skills** in their actual physical environment.  

**Why It's Great for XR?**  
- Showcases the future of **natural interaction** beyond controllers  
- Leverages **passthrough AR** for safer play in personal spaces  
- Opens new possibilities for **accessibility** in rhythm games
